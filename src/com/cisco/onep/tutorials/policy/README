QOS Policy Tutorial
--------------------------

This tutorial shows how a onePK application creates a QOS Policy. The QOS
Policy object is a top level object in a hierarchy of objects that define
class, filter and action objects for applying QOS policy to interface targets.

The Policy object is associated with a target (or interface). A Policy may
have a child policy.

A QOS policy may have the following Actions:

 - Mark packet
 - Shape traffic
 - Police traffic
 - Priority queue
 - Class-based queue
 - Fair queue
 - Weighted Random Early Discard (WRED)

Class objects are used to classify packet flows through the Network Element.
Each Class object may contain several Filter objects. When a Class is included
in a Policy it may be associated with several Actions. When one of the
Filters in the Class is matched the associated Actions in the Class are
performed.

Multiple Class objects can be defined within a Policy object. For example,
several Class objects may be used to define a Policy with a set of different
queuing Actions. Each Class in a Policy has a sequence number which is used
to order the evaluation and triggering of filters between the different
Classes in the same Policy.

A Class may also be added to one or more Policies. A Class must be removed
from all Policy objects before it can be deleted. In the Java API a Class is
called a ClassMap.

The Filter object specifies the events to be matched. There may be several
Filter objects in a Class object. A Filter cannot be added to more than
one Class. There are different types of Filter objects that specify the
details of each filter event to be matched. The following filters are
supported:

- Access Control List (ACL) Filter. ACL filters reference an ACL that has been
  set up on the same Network Element. See the ACL Tutorial.

- Packet Length Filter. This provides a filter on minimum and maximum IP 
  packet lengths.
 
- DSCP Filter. This provides a match on the DSCP field in the IP header.

- L2 Class of Service Filter. L2 COS refers to Priority Code Point (PCP) field
  in 802.1Q tagged Ethernet frames.

- MAC Filter. This provides a match on Ethernet source and destination MAC 
  addresses.

- QOS Group Filter. A QOS group is an internal tag that can be a attached to a 
  packet.
  Up to 8 QOS group values may be added to each filter.

- MPLS Experimental Label Filter. This provides a match on the MPLS 
  Experimental Label.
 
- Protocol Filter. This provides a match on a wide variety of L3 and L4 
  protocols.
  Protocol filters may be loaded onto a Network Element using NBAR Protocol 
  Packs,
  Protocol filters may be loaded onto a Network Element using NBAR Protocol 
  Packs,
  or created using the CLI. The ONEP Application is able learn about all NBAR 
  protocols
  that are currently available on the Network Element.
 
- VLAN Filter. This provides a match on the VLAN field of 802.1Q tagged
  Ethernet frames. Up to 8 VLANs may be added to a VLAN filter.

Steps to take. There are four steps to set up a QOS Policy:

 - Create the QOS Policy on the Network Element.
 - Create a Class on the Network Element and add the Class to the Policy.
 - Create Filters and add them to the Class.
 - Create Actions and add them to the Class in the Policy.
 - Apply the Policy to the interface Target. At this point the Policy is
   active on the Network Element.
   

To build these tutorials:

    export CLASSPATH='onePK-sdk-<version>/java/lib/*:.'
    cd onePK-sdk-<version>/java/tutorials/src/main/java
    javac com/cisco/onep/tutorials/policy/ACLTutorial.java
    javac com/cisco/onep/tutorials/policy/QOSTutorial.java

To run these tutorials:

    java \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=<path to keyStore>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=<keyStore password>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<path to trustStore>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<trustStore password>] \

         -a <element address> -u <username> -p <password> \
        [-t <0=tls | 1=tcp>]
    java \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=<path to keyStore>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=<keyStore password>] \

         -a <element address> -u <username> -p <password> \
        [-t <0=tls | 1=tcp>]

    Where username and password are configured on the network element
    you are connecting to.
